“Sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart.”  - Winne the pooh 

It amazes me that the room in my heart is taken up by you. 
All the noise and the chaos, and the love and the faith that I will catch you when you fall 
I will be there to hold your hand when you need it 
and push you because I know you are strong
You may be small, but you can do big things and I promise there will still be room for you inside my heart.
